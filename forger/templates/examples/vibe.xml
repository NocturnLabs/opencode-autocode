# Agent Orientation Guide (Vibe Discovery)

Use this guide to orient yourself quickly when starting a session in an existing project.

## 1. Quick Orientation

**DO NOT** run `ls -R`. Instead, check for these markers to identify the project state:

- **`.forger/progress.db`**: SQLite database tracking all features and their status.
- **`forger.toml`**: Agent settings (models, timeouts, etc.).
- **`.conductor/tracks/`**: Active development plans and session history.
- **`app_spec.md`**: The source of truth for requirements.

## 2. Identify Tech Stack

Check for lockfiles to detect environment:

- `bun.lockb` / `package.lock` / `yarn.lock` → Node.js/JavaScript (Prefer Bun)
- `Cargo.toml` → Rust
- `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` → Python
- `go.mod` → Go

## 3. Query Progress

Run these commands to see what's left to do:

```bash
# Total progress
opencode-forger db stats

# Next feature to build
opencode-forger db next-feature
```

## 4. Check Active Tracks

If `.conductor/tracks/` has subdirectories, check the most recent one for `plan.md`:

```bash
# Check if a plan is in progress
ls -t .conductor/tracks/*/plan.md | head -n 1 | xargs cat
```

## 5. Summary Protocol

At the end of your session, ALWAYS write to `.forger/session.log` summarizing:

1. What you finished
2. What you broke (and if you fixed it)
3. Where the next agent should pick up
