# Recovery Module (Stuck Protocol)

Read this module when you've failed 3+ times on the same feature.

---

## STOP - You Are Stuck

If an edit or fix fails 3 times in a row:

1. **STOP** - Do NOT try the same approach again

2. **DOCUMENT**:

   ```
   BLOCKED: [feature name] - [brief reason]
   Attempted: [what you tried]
   ```

3. **RESEARCH** - Use ALL available tools:
1. **STOP** - Do NOT try the same approach again

   - **Documentation**: Look up official docs
   - **Web Search**: Search for similar issues
   - **Read the actual error messages** carefully
   - **Check imports and dependencies** that might be missing

---

## Generate Alternative Approaches

Think through 5-7 fundamentally different ways to implement this feature:

- What's the simplest possible approach? (even if not ideal)
- What would a different framework/library enable?
- What if you restructured the data model?
- What if you changed the API contract?
- What approach would prioritize debuggability over elegance?
- What's an unconventional solution you'd normally dismiss?

```
ALTERNATIVE_APPROACHES: [feature name]
1. [approach] - [trade-off]
2. [approach] - [trade-off]
...
Selected: [which approach and why]
```

---

## Try a Different Solution

Pick an approach that is **NOT** a variation of what you already tried.

---

## If Still Stuck After 3 Different Approaches

Document everything and **move to the next feature**:

```
BLOCKED: [feature name]
Reason: [root cause if known]
Research findings: [what you learned]
Approaches tried: [list]
Recommended next step: [suggestion for future session]
```

Then pick the next highest-priority feature with `passes = 0` and continue.

---

## Signs You Are Stuck (Trigger This Protocol Immediately)

- Repeating "Let me try a different approach" multiple times
- Same file edit failing with "oldString and newString must be different"
- Same compilation error appearing after multiple fix attempts
- Trying the same fix pattern with minor variations

**NEVER** get stuck in infinite retry loops. Generate alternatives FIRST, then act.
