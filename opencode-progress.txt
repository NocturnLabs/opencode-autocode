# OpenCode Autocode - Session 1 Progress

## Session Summary
Verified and documented initial setup for opencode-autocode project. Project was already fully initialized with feature_list.json, init.sh, and proper project structure.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Project Analysis
- Identified project: OpenCode Forger - Rust CLI for scaffolding autonomous coding projects
- Analyzed technology stack: Rust 2021, SQLite (rusqlite), iocraft TUI, Handlebars, Actix Web
- Mapped architecture: Vibe Loop (5-phase autonomous engine), dual-model architecture, Progressive Discovery templates
- Reviewed key modules: autonomous/, db/, scaffold/, conductor/, templates/

### 2. Feature List Verification
Verified comprehensive `feature_list.json` exists with 42 test cases:
- **Functional Tests (38)**: CLI scaffolding, database operations (init, migrate, query, knowledge), vibe loop, developer mode, regression testing, security enforcement, webhooks, MCP integration
- **Style Tests (4)**: CLI help output, error messages, colored output, progress display
- All tests marked with `"passes": false` as required

### 3. Environment Setup Verification
Verified `init.sh` exists with robust functionality:
- Prerequisite checking (Rust, Cargo, Git, OpenCode CLI)
- Project build with cargo
- Test execution
- Installation verification
- Quick start guidance

### 4. Git Repository Status
- Branch: `chore/modularization`
- Initial commit present: `c3a733d Initial setup: feature_list.json, init.sh, and project structure`
- Working tree clean for tracked files

### 5. Project Structure Confirmed
- src/ (main.rs, lib.rs + autonomous/, cli/, conductor/, config/, config_tui/, db/, tui/, web/)
- templates/ (commands/, core/, modules/, projects/, scaffold/, scripts/)
- tests/ (integration.rs, robustness.rs, handlebars_escaping.rs, regression/)
- docs/ (architecture, development guide, examples)
- openspec/ (project context and AGENTS.md)

## Next Steps
Ready for Session 2. Recommended actions:
1. Run `init.sh` to verify environment setup
2. Execute `cargo test` to verify existing tests
3. Begin implementing features from feature_list.json
4. Prioritize: Database operations → Vibe Loop → Template System

## Environment Status
- Foundation complete ✓
- All required files committed ✓
- Build system functional ✓
- Ready for feature implementation
