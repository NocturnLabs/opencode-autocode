Main goal: Create a plugin for OpenCode similar to the one in the Claude Autonomous Repo, this will be an autonomous coding plugin that mimics the identical functionality of the Claude Autonomous Repo but for OpenCode.

Our Enhancements: We have a few mcps that we want to add to the plugin. The plugin has access to a chat history MCP that should act as a primary information database that is a free request, and is local personal knowledge database full of reasoning gathered by the user, Perplexica which is a web search tool hosted by the user and deep wiki which is a documentation project all MCPs can be used for tasks however the order that they should be used in starts from chat history first and that knowledge should not be taken as the end all be all then deep wiki then perplexica search.
We also have a MCP called sequential thinking, it's your task to find out what sequential thinking does, how it works, and implement that into the autonomous plug-in functionality.

Secondary goal:
Opencode features a local and a global configuration file. I need you to turn our plugin into a Rust CLI tool that sets up the plugin within local projects. That way we do not have to hard code it and have issues later on when we have two instances of open code, one not pertaining to the project that we're trying to work with. So the Rust CLI tool needs to scaffold our autonomous coding plugin.
Our scaffolding tool will need three sets of functionality. One will be a default app spec that we provide as a template. Number two will be the user can provide their own defined app spec. Or three, the user gets an interactive ratatui TUI that helps them build out a app spec. So we should take the information from our app spec and utilize that to create a form for our TUI to generate the plugin.

Important: As last time an issue with the anti-gravity editor deleted the progress that we had for the plugin by using an undo button, I would like you to keep a running Markdown document that contains everything that you do to the project from tool calls, our conversation history to files edited when they were edited, etc. You should also begin committing and version control this every step of the way.
