# OpenCode Autocode

A Rust CLI that scaffolds autonomous coding projects for [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) and runs them to completion. It bridges the gap between high-level application specs and fully implemented features.

> [!WARNING]
> **AI-Generated Code Disclaimer**: Significant portions of this codebase (including logic, templates, and tests) were generated or refined using Large Language Models. Use with appropriate caution and always review changes in your local projects.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Scaffold a new project (Interactive TUI)
opencode-autocode --interactive

# 2. Configure project settings
opencode-autocode --config

# 3. Start the autonomous vibe loop
opencode-autocode vibe --developer
```

## Features

- 🚀 **Zero-Config Scaffolding**: Build complex app specs using a rich interactive TUI, now stored in `.autocode/`.
- 🗃️ **SQLite Persistence**: Industrial-grade progress tracking with a relational database (`.autocode/progress.db`).
- 🧠 **Persistent Agent Knowledge**: Agents can save discovered facts (ports, paths, keys) to a persistent Key-Value store (`db knowledge`).
- 🔄 **Vibe Loop**: Automated session management with intelligent continuation and exponential backoff retry logic.
- ⚡ **Bun First**: Enforces `bun` usage for JS/TS projects (install, scripts, tests) for maximum speed.
- 🎯 **Single-Feature Isolation**: Enforces a strict one-feature-per-session rule to minimize context bloat and regressions.
- 🧠 **Conductor Workflow**: Context-driven planning that creates persistent `.conductor/` and `tracks/` directories to maintain project state.
- 📝 **Developer Mode**: Detailed output captured in `opencode-debug.log` for debugging autonomous sessions.
- ✅ **Auto-Commit**: Automatically commits each completed feature to Git with AI-generated messages.
- 🔁 **Stuck Recovery**: Automatically generates alternative implementation paths when progress stalls.
- 🧪 **Regression Testing**: CLI command to verify all previously completed features directly from the database.
- 🚀 **Dashboard Webhooks**: Real-time Discord/Slack dashboard that updates a single message with project status and progress bars.

- 🛠️ **MCP Native**: First-class support for Model Context Protocol tools like `osgrep`, `chrome-devtools`, and `sequential-thinking`.
- 🔌 **Port Conflict Prevention**: Automatic detection and resolution of port conflicts before starting servers or tests.
- 📦 **Module Verification**: Validates ES6 import/export consistency to prevent ReferenceErrors at runtime.
- 🧩 **Progressive Discovery**: Modular template system that reduces context window usage by ~80%.
- 🧠 **Dual-Model Architecture**: Reasoning model plans, `@coder` subagent implements — cleaner separation of concerns.
- 💬 **Agent-User Communication**: Polling-based Q&A channel via `.autocode/COMMUNICATION.md` for async collaboration.
- ✅ **Spec Validation**: Validates generated specifications for structural correctness before scaffolding.

## CLI Reference

### Scaffolding Mode

- `--interactive` (alias: `--init`): Start the interactive spec-building TUI.
- `--default`: Scaffold using the built-in default template immediately.
- `--spec <FILE>`: Use a custom markdown specification file.
- `--output <DIR>` (alias: `-o`): Specify the target directory for scaffolding.
- `--preview` (alias: `--dry-run`): Preview what will be created without writing to disk.
- `--no-subagents`: Disable parallel subagent spec generation (use legacy single-pass).

### Vibe Mode (Autonomous Loop)

- `vibe`: Start the main session loop.
  - `--developer`: Enable verbose debug logging to file.
  - `--limit <N>`: Stop the loop after N iterations.
  - `--config-file <FILE>`: Load a custom TOML configuration.
  - `--single-model`: Disable dual-model (use one model for both reasoning and coding).

### Database Operations

- `db init`: Initialize a new progress database.
- `db migrate`: Import legacy `feature_list.json` data into the SQLite database.
- `db stats`: View high-level feature and session statistics.
- `db export <FILE>`: Export the database contents to a JSON file.
- `db query "<SQL>"`: Execute a SELECT query and display results.
- `db exec "<SQL>"`: Execute a write query (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE).
- `db tables`: List all tables in the database.
- `db schema <table>`: Show the schema for a specific table.
- `db next-feature`: Get the next incomplete feature.
- `db mark-pass <id>`: Mark a feature as passing.
- `db knowledge set <key> <value>`: Save a persistent fact (flags: `--category`, `--description`).
- `db knowledge get <key>`: Recall a saved fact.
- `db knowledge list`: List all saved facts.

### Utility Commands

- `--config`: Launch the settings configuration TUI.
- `--regression-check`: Verify all features marked as passing in the database.
- `templates list`: View available project templates (Web App, CLI, API).
- `templates use <name>`: Scaffold a project directly from a named template.

## Configuration

Settings are stored in `.autocode/config.toml`. You can either use `opencode-autocode --config` or edit the file manually. Paths support environment variables like `$HOME`.

```toml
[models]
default = "opencode/glm-4.7-free"       # Used for spec generation

## How It Works: The 5-Phase Loop

When you run `vibe`, the engine determines the next action using a phased approach:

1.  **Phase 1: Init** (`auto-init`) → Populates the database (`.autocode/progress.db`) and basic structure.
2.  **Phase 2: Context** (`auto-context`) → Establishes project-wide product and technical requirements.
3.  **Phase 3: Continue** (`auto-continue`) → Executes the next task in the active `plan.md` (Track mode).
4.  **Phase 4: Completion** → Checks if all features pass; if so, terminates the loop gracefully.
5.  **Phase 5: Transition** (`auto-continue`) → If no active track exists, picks the next failing feature to implement.

## Template Architecture: Progressive Discovery

Command templates use a modular "Progressive Discovery" system to minimize token usage:

```
templates/
├── index.json           # Routing table for project types
├── core/                # Always-included fundamentals
│   ├── identity.md      # Agent identity (6 lines)
│   ├── security.md      # Security constraints (16 lines)
│   └── ...
├── modules/             # Read on-demand by the agent
│   ├── javascript.md    # Web/JS specifics (ports, imports)
│   ├── rust.md          # CLI/Rust patterns
│   ├── testing.md       # Playwright, E2E protocols
│   └── recovery.md      # Stuck protocol
├── commands/
│   ├── auto-init-v2.md     # Lean entry point (~100 lines)
│   └── auto-continue-v2.md # Lean entry point (~80 lines)
```

The agent reads specialized modules only when needed, reducing context window consumption by ~80%.

## Dual-Model Architecture

The vibe loop uses two models with distinct roles:

| Model | Config Key | Role |
|-------|------------|------|
| **Reasoning** | `models.reasoning` | Plans, reviews, architects — never writes code |
| **Coding** | `models.autonomous` | Implements exactly what it's told via `@coder` subagent |

### How It Works

1. The reasoning model analyzes the feature and plans the implementation
2. It delegates code writing to `@coder`:
   ```
   @coder Create src/auth/login.ts that exports a login(email, password) function...
   ```
3. The reasoning model reviews the output and runs tests
4. If issues arise, it provides fix instructions to `@coder`

Use `--single-model` to disable this and use one model for everything.

## Requirements
