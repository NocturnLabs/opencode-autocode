# Enhancement Discovery Session

Research and propose enhancements for the current project based on popular patterns, best practices, and community recommendations.

---

### SECURITY CONSTRAINTS (MANDATORY)

**Before executing ANY commands:**

1. Read `.forger/security-allowlist.json` if it exists
2. Check the `blocked_patterns` array - commands matching these are FORBIDDEN
3. Only use commands listed in `allowed_commands` categories

---

### STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE PROJECT

Read app_spec.md and .forger/features.json to understand:

- What the project does
- What technology stack is used
- Current features and goals
- What has been implemented so far

---

### STEP 2: RESEARCH ENHANCEMENTS

Use your available MCPs to discover enhancement opportunities:

#### 2.1 Web Search

Search for:

- "popular features for [project type] applications 2025"
- "best practices [technology stack] 2025"
- "[project domain] UX improvements"
- "performance optimizations [framework/language]"
- "trending [project type] features"

#### 2.2 Documentation

Look up:

- Official documentation for recommended patterns
- New features in dependencies that could be leveraged
- Best practices guides from framework maintainers

#### 2.3 Local Knowledge

Check for:

- Similar enhancements made in past projects
- Patterns that worked well before
- Common improvements for this type of application

---

### STEP 3: EVALUATE ENHANCEMENTS

For each potential enhancement, consider:

1. **Relevance** - Does it fit the project's goals?
2. **Impact** - How much value does it add?
3. **Effort** - How complex is the implementation?
4. **Risk** - Could it break existing features?
5. **Dependencies** - Does it require new dependencies?

---

### STEP 4: PROPOSE ENHANCEMENTS

Create or update `proposed_enhancements.md` with:

```markdown
# Proposed Enhancements

## Enhancement 1: [Name]

- **Description**: What this enhancement adds
- **Difficulty**: Easy / Medium / Hard
- **Priority**: High / Medium / Low
- **Impact**: What value it provides
- **Implementation Notes**: Brief approach
- **Source**: Where you found this recommendation

## Enhancement 2: [Name]

...
```

Order enhancements by priority (highest impact, lowest effort first).

---

### STEP 5: DO NOT AUTO-IMPLEMENT

**IMPORTANT:** This command is for DISCOVERY only.

- Research enhancements
- Document findings
- Propose additions
- Wait for approval

Do NOT automatically implement any enhancements.
The user will review and select which to pursue.

---

### STEP 6: UPDATE PROGRESS

Add to `.forger/session.log`:

- That you ran enhancement discovery
- How many enhancements were found
- Summary of top recommendations
- Pointer to proposed_enhancements.md

---

### STEP 7: OPTIONALLY ADD TO FEATURE LIST

If the user has pre-approved certain types of enhancements, you may add
them to .forger/features.json with:

- Category: "enhancement"
- Detailed testing steps
- `"passes": false`

But only if explicitly told to do so. By default, just propose.

---

## EXAMPLE SEARCHES BY PROJECT TYPE

**Web Application:**

- "web app accessibility improvements 2025"
- "responsive design best practices"
- "progressive web app features"
- "web performance optimization techniques"

**CLI Tool:**

- "CLI UX best practices"
- "terminal application features users love"
- "rust CLI progress indicators"
- "command line help system patterns"

**API/Backend:**

- "REST API design improvements"
- "API rate limiting best practices"
- "backend caching strategies"
- "API documentation tools"

**Data Processing:**

- "data pipeline optimization"
- "batch processing patterns"
- "error handling strategies"
- "logging and monitoring best practices"

---

## MCP USAGE FOR THIS COMMAND

This command relies heavily on MCPs:

1. **Code Search** - Search codebase efficiently (e.g., ripgrep)

   - Prefer semantic search for smaller context window footprint
   - Use for understanding current implementation patterns

2. **Web Search** (PRIMARY) - Search for trends and popular features
3. **Documentation** - Look up official best practices (e.g., deepwiki)
4. **Local Knowledge** - Check what worked before
5. **Structured Reasoning** - Evaluate and prioritize findings

Use structured reasoning to organize your findings and determine priority.
