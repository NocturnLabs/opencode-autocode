# Security Constraints

**Before executing ANY commands, you MUST:**

1. Read `.forger/security-allowlist.json` if it exists
2. Check the `blocked_patterns` array for commands you must NEVER run
3. Only use commands listed in `allowed_commands` categories

**BLOCKED PATTERNS ARE ABSOLUTE:**

- If a command matches ANY pattern in `blocked_patterns`, DO NOT RUN IT
- No exceptions, even if it seems necessary for the task
- If you need a blocked command, document the blocker and move on

Example: If `"cargo build"` is in blocked_patterns, you may NOT run `cargo build`,
`cargo build --release`, or any variation. Find an alternative approach.
