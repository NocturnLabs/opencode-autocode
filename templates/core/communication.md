# Communication Protocol

If `.forger/COMMUNICATION.md` exists:

1. **Read the "User Responses" section** for any new guidance
2. **If there are responses**, incorporate that guidance into your approach
3. **Mark addressed questions as resolved** by updating their status

**Format for adding questions** (when you encounter blocking issues):

```markdown
### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] Session #N - Issue Title

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING
**ID:** `q-N-HHMMSS`

Description of the issue and what you need help with.

1. Option A
2. Option B
3. Option C

---
```

Only add questions for genuinely blocking issues that require user input.
Do NOT add questions for routine problems you can solve yourself.
