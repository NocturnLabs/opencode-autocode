# Conductor Tracks and Planning Guide

The Conductor system manages multi-session work through "tracks". Each track represents a major objective broken down into a plan.

## 1. Directory Structure

```text
.conductor/
├── product.md       # Product requirements and objectives
├── tech_stack.md    # Technology choices and constraints
└── tracks/
    └── [track_id]/
        ├── plan.md      # Checklist of tasks for this track
        └── sessions/    # History of agent sessions for this track
```

## 2. Plan State Machine

The `plan.md` file uses a standard checklist format:

- `[ ]` **Unstarted**: Task has not been attempted.
- `[/]` **In Progress**: An agent is currently working on this task.
- `[x]` **Completed**: Task is finished and verified.

**AGENT RULE**: Never work on more than one `[/]` task at a time.

## 3. Session Lifecycle

1. **Pick a Task**: Find the first `[ ]` task in `plan.md`.
2. **Mark In Progress**: Change it to `[/]`.
3. **Execute**: Do the coding work.
4. **Verify**: Run tests to prove completion.
5. **Mark Done**: Change it to `[x]`.

## 4. Retiring Tracks

When all tasks in `plan.md` are marked `[x]`, the Conductor will automatically retire the track. If you find the plan is no longer valid, document the reason in a new session log and let the Conductor re-plan.
