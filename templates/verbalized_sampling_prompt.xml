# Task: Generate Alternative Approaches (Stuck Recovery)

This prompt is triggered when an implementation attempt has **failed 3+ times**. The goal is to break out of mode collapse and explore fundamentally different solutions.

## Context: Why This Was Triggered

The autonomous agent attempted to implement a feature but got stuck in a retry loop. Direct approaches have failed. Now we need to force exploration of alternatives that would normally be dismissed.

## Feature That Is Stuck

**Feature:**
{{FEATURE_DESCRIPTION}}

**Technology Stack:**
{{TECH_STACK}}

**Project Context:**
{{PROJECT_CONTEXT}}

**What Has Already Been Tried:**
{{FAILED_APPROACHES}}

**Error Messages/Symptoms:**
{{ERROR_CONTEXT}}

## Requirements

Generate **7 fundamentally different** implementation approaches. Do NOT generate variations of what has already been tried—each approach should be distinct.

**Approach Categories to Explore:**

1. **Simplest Possible** - What's the absolute minimum viable solution?
2. **Different Library/Framework** - What if you used a different tool entirely?
3. **Restructured Data Model** - What if the data was organized differently?
4. **Changed API Contract** - What if the interface was different?
5. **Debuggability First** - What approach would make debugging easiest?
6. **Unconventional** - What solution would you normally dismiss as "weird"?
7. **Workaround** - What if you can't solve the core issue directly?

**For each approach, provide:**

- Clear description of the approach
- Why it's fundamentally different from what was tried
- The main trade-off
- Likelihood it will avoid the previous error

## Output Format

```json
{
  "alternative_approaches": [
    {
      "approach": "Description of the alternative approach",
      "category": "simplest|different_tool|restructured_data|changed_api|debuggable|unconventional|workaround",
      "why_different": "Why this avoids the previous failure mode",
      "trade_off": "The main downside of this approach",
      "avoids_error": "high|medium|low"
    }
  ],
  "recommended": {
    "index": 0,
    "reasoning": "Why this specific approach is recommended given the error context"
  }
}
```

## Important

- Do NOT suggest variations of failed approaches
- Do NOT optimize for elegance—optimize for "actually works"
- Consider that the stuck condition may indicate a fundamental misunderstanding
- Sometimes the right answer is to change the requirements, not the implementation

Generate 7 alternative approaches now.
