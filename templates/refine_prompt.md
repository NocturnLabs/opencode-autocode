# Task: Refine Project Specification

Review the existing specification and apply the user's refinement instructions. Maintain the XML format while improving content based on their feedback.

## Existing Specification

```xml
{{EXISTING_SPEC}}
```

## Refinement Request

{{REFINEMENT}}

## Process

1. Parse the current specification thoroughly
2. Apply the user's refinement request precisely
3. Preserve all existing good elements unless explicitly asked to change them
4. Improve the specification while keeping the same structure
5. Use web search and documentation tools if research is needed

## Output

Output the COMPLETE refined specification in the same XML format. Include ALL sections from the original, modified as needed.

Output ONLY the XML specification—no preamble, no commentary.
