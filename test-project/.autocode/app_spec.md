  <project_name>Local Todo App</project_name>
  <overview>A lightweight, browser-based todo list application that runs entirely in the client environment without server dependencies. The application provides a clean, intuitive interface for managing daily tasks with full CRUD operations. Built using vanilla TypeScript and HTML, it leverages localStorage for persistent data storage across browser sessions. The app focuses on simplicity and performance, eliminating the need for external frameworks, authentication systems, or backend infrastructure. Users can create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete with immediate visual feedback. All data remains private and local to the user's browser, making it ideal for personal task management without privacy concerns.</overview>
  <technology_stack>Frontend: TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3; Backend: None (client-side only); Storage: localStorage API; DevOps: Static file hosting</technology_stack>
  <prerequisites>Modern web browser with JavaScript and localStorage support, text editor for development, local web server for testing (optional).</prerequisites>

  <!-- From @spec-product -->
  <core_features>Task Management: Create new tasks with descriptive text, Edit existing task content inline, Delete tasks with confirmation, Mark tasks as complete/incomplete with visual toggle, View all tasks in a unified list interface. Data Persistence: Automatic save to localStorage on all changes, Load saved tasks on application start, Handle localStorage quota and errors gracefully, Export/import tasks as JSON for backup. User Interface: Clean, responsive design for desktop and mobile, Real-time updates without page refresh, Visual feedback for all user actions, Keyboard shortcuts for common operations, Task counter showing total and completed items.</core_features>
  <user_experience>Intuitive Interaction: Click-to-edit task functionality, Checkbox for quick completion toggle, Smooth animations and transitions, Clear visual hierarchy with typography, Consistent color scheme for states. Performance &amp; Accessibility: Instant response to all user actions, No network latency or loading delays, Semantic HTML for screen reader compatibility, Keyboard navigation support, High contrast mode compatibility. Error Handling: Graceful localStorage failure fallback, Data validation on input, Undo functionality for accidental deletions, Clear error messages for user guidance, Auto-recovery from corrupted data.</user_experience>

  <!-- From @spec-architecture -->
  <database_schema>Since this is a client-only application using localStorage, there is no traditional database. The data structure stored in localStorage will be: interface Todo { id: string; title: string; completed: boolean; createdAt: string; updatedAt: string; } localStorage key: &apos;todos&apos;, Value: JSON stringified array of Todo objects.</database_schema>
  <api_endpoints>No server-side API endpoints are required for this local-only application. All data operations are handled client-side through the following internal methods: Todo Management Functions: getTodos(): Todo[] - Retrieve all todos from localStorage, addTodo(title: string): Todo - Create new todo and save to localStorage, updateTodo(id: string, updates: Partial&lt;Todo&gt;): Todo - Update existing todo, deleteTodo(id: string): void - Remove todo from localStorage, toggleTodo(id: string): Todo - Toggle completion status. Storage Operations: saveToLocalStorage(todos: Todo[]): void - Persist todo array, loadFromLocalStorage(): Todo[] - Load todos on app initialization. All operations are synchronous and work directly with the browser&apos;s localStorage API.</api_endpoints>

  <!-- From @spec-quality -->
  <security>Data Privacy: All todo data remains exclusively within the user's browser localStorage, eliminating external data transmission risks. No server communication means no attack surface for data breaches. Input Validation: Implement client-side sanitization for todo text input to prevent XSS attacks through HTML injection. Use textContent instead of innerHTML when rendering todo items. Storage Security: localStorage data is accessible only within the same origin, providing natural isolation between different websites and applications.</security>
  <testing_strategy>Unit Testing: Test core TypeScript functions (addTodo, deleteTodo, toggleTodo, editTodo) using Jest or similar framework. Verify data manipulation logic and localStorage interactions. Integration Testing: Test complete user workflows - creating todos, editing, marking complete, and deleting. Verify localStorage persistence across browser sessions. Manual Testing: Cross-browser compatibility testing on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Test localStorage behavior and UI responsiveness on different screen sizes.</testing_strategy>
  <implementation_steps>1. Project Setup: Create HTML structure with semantic elements, set up TypeScript configuration, and establish basic CSS styling for the todo interface. 2. Core Functionality: Implement Todo class/interface, CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), and localStorage integration for data persistence. 3. User Interface: Build dynamic DOM manipulation for todo rendering, event handlers for user interactions, and visual feedback for task completion. 4. Data Management: Implement localStorage serialization/deserialization, data validation, and error handling for storage operations. 5. Enhancement Features: Add filtering (all/active/completed), todo counter, and clear completed functionality.</implementation_steps>
  <success_criteria>Functional Requirements: Users can create, edit, delete, and toggle todo completion status with immediate visual feedback. Data Persistence: All todos persist across browser sessions and survive page refreshes. User Experience: Clean, intuitive interface with responsive design and smooth interactions. Performance: Fast load times (&lt;1 second) and efficient DOM manipulation. Browser Compatibility: Works on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).</success_criteria>
  <future_enhancements>Advanced Features: Drag-and-drop reordering, due dates with reminders, priority levels, and todo categories/tags. Data Management: Import/export functionality for backup/restore, data synchronization across browser tabs, and search/filter capabilities. User Experience: Dark mode theme, keyboard shortcuts, animations/transitions, and mobile-optimized touch interactions. Development: TypeScript strict mode implementation, automated testing suite, and build optimization for production deployment.</future_enhancements>
